# My Third Fullstack Project
## Website for booking seats and buying cinema tickets

## Introduction
Welcome to my third fullstack application project! This project is a sophisticated client-server application aimed at enhancing my skills in web development, with a focus on AJAX-based asynchronous communication, and efficient data management using local storage. The application features a fully functional server-client architecture, handling various HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST) using fxmlhttprequest and fxhttp for network operations.

## Project Overview
This application is designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience through asynchronous server-client communication. The server is responsible for managing data operations, while the client handles user interactions and displays dynamic content. Local storage is utilized to ensure data persistence, enabling the application to retain user information and state across sessions.

## Key Features
- **User Account Management:** Users can create accounts and log in, with secure handling of user credentials and session data.
- **Server-Client Architecture:** A well-defined architecture that separates server-side and client-side functionalities for streamlined data processing and communication.
- **AJAX Requests:** Implementation of asynchronous HTTP requests (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST) using fxmlhttprequest and fxhttp for real-time data updates without page reloads.
- **Local Storage:** Persistent storage of user data and application state in the browser to enhance user experience.
- **Database Management:** A dedicated db file containing classes and functions for data operations, including retrieval, storage, and updates.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the client-side content.
- **CSS:** For styling the client-side interface.
- **JavaScript:** For client-side logic, including AJAX requests and dynamic content updates.
- **Local Storage:** For persisting user data and application state.
- **Server-Side Scripting:** For managing server operations and handling HTTP requests.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
- **Mastering AJAX for Server-Client Communication:** Gain proficiency in using AJAX to manage asynchronous server-client interactions and data updates.
- **Implementing Comprehensive HTTP Methods:** Learn to handle various HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST) for complete CRUD operations.
- **Utilizing Local Storage for Data Persistence:** Effectively use local storage to maintain user data and application state across sessions.
- **Developing a Functional Database System:** Create a functional database system with classes and functions to manage data operations efficiently.
